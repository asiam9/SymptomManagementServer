SMServer
========
<p>
Coursera Mobile Cloud Computing with Android Capstone REST Spring Server project 2014</p>

<p>This is the cloud server app for the matching Symptom Management App project.  Detailed Documentation (pdf and video) for this project and for the app can be found in the App's repository at https://github.com/dmdavids/SymptomManagementApp</p>
<p>
A "real" server would have significantly more security and other privacy requirements due to health regulations.  This server is implemented as a local server in the Eclipse environment.  This server implements Spring Security and OAuth2 but the certificates and keystore are not meant to used in production environment.  This is a demo project only.</p>
<p>
Dependencies for the Server Project:</p>
<p>
Spring Boot</p>
<p>
Mongo DB  see http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/ </p>
<p>
Spring Security</p>
<p>
OAuth2</p>
<p>
Square Retrofit</p>
<p>
JUnit</p>
<p>
As much as I would haved liked to develop a full suite of test cases, unfortunately the amount of work on this project did not allow me enough time to do this in the given time frame.
